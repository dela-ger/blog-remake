# Blog-remake
This site was built as a remake of the first Blog website I built but 
for some reason unknown to me, anytime I deployed it, it gave me a blank screen.

If anyone has a reason for the error I will gladly listen. I think it was from when I tried to deploy on GitHub. Had no problem deploying on Netlify.
